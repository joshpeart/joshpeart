- 👋 Hi, I’m @joshpeart
- 👀 I currently work as a Senior End User Support Technician.  At work, I'm in the Microsoft world.  At home, I prefer Linux.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Python programming language and eventually would like to move over to a DevOps Engineer type role after I gain more experience.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything under the sun.  I have limited coding ability at this point but have significant experience on the infrastructure side.
- 📫 Feel free to contact me at joshepea@gmail.com.
